I'm sorry. But I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. 
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. 
I should like to help everyone if possible. 
Jew, Gentile, black man, White. We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that. 
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.
We don't want to hate and despise one another. 
In this world, there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way. 
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, 
has goose stepped us into misery and bloodshed. 
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. 
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. 
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. 
We think too much and feel too little. More the machinery.
We need humanity more than cleverness.
